# hello-world
My first repository

## My first commit
This will be my **very first** commit on Github. I have already have a fair amount of experience with programming in *Python* and *C++* from a series of different University courses and am familiar with object-oriented programming, but haven't programmed in any professional setting yet. I'm simply starting from scratch through this `hello-world` introduction in attempt to quickly learn the best practises around [here](https://github.com/). Here's a picture of Vitalik

giving me two thumbs up as I start my journey as a Solidity developer.
